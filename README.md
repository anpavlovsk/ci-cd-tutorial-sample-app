# CD/CI Tutorial Sample Application

## Description

This sample Python REST API application was written for a tutorial on implementing Continuous Integration and Delivery pipelines.


It demonstrates how to:

 * Write a basic REST API using the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) microframework
 * Basic database operations and migrations using the Flask wrappers around [Alembic](https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic) and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org)
 * Write automated unit tests with [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)

Also:

 * How to use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

## Features:
- Reusable action workflows, that can be called from previous one
- Deploy to Prod workflow also requires manual approval in addition, after all previous checks and builds were completed and passed
- The application is deployed to AWS using ElastickBeanstalk service (Url links for Dev and Prod apps basic functionality response are available here):
http://test-environment.eba-kupdirkf.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
http://productionenv-env.eba-j3j3u7ux.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
- Application's built versions are stored as artifacts in the Docker Hub
